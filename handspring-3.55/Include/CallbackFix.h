 *  FileName:
 *	  CallbackFix.h
 *
 *  Description:	
 *      Macros for fixing up A4 (GNU GCC-style) globals in
 *	  GCC-compiled callback functions that are called from
 *	  non-GCC code.
 *	  
 *	    Note:  these routines are now obsolete because gcc
 *	   2.95 switched to use A5 for globals instead of A4. 
 *	  
 * From Ian Goldberg (reformatted):
 *   Routines compiled by gcc, but called by routines _not_ compiled by gcc
 * (most commonly, your event handlers) have their globals sometimes broken,
 * unless you use a workaround.
 * 
 * At the top of the callback (right after the var. declarations), put
 * 
 * CALLBACK_PROLOGUE();
 * 
 * At the bottom (just before the return), put
 * 
 * CALLBACK_EPILOGUE();
 * 
 * Make _sure_ the event handler can _only_ exit by going through the
 * CALLBACK_EPILOGUE.
 * 
 * This is a workaround for a bug in the older version of gcc:
 * gcc assumes that no one will touch %a4 after it is set up in crt0.o.
 * This isn't true if a function is called as a callback by something
 * that wasn't compiled by gcc (like FrmCloseAllForms()).  It may also
 * not be true if it is used as a callback by something in a different
 * shared library.
 * We really want a function attribute "callback" which will insert this
 * progloue and epilogoue automatically.
 * - Ian 
 *
 * ALSO: the "-mvolatile-gp" GCC compiler flag may be used to force the compiler
 *		  to generate this code automatically.
 *
 *
 *  History:
 *	19-Apr-1999  vmk  Initial version
 *	08-Oct-1999  BP   Converted to shared include format
 *	14-Apr-2000  BP   Updated for latest gcc (no longer needed)
