*  Project:

*  FileName:
*	NewTypes.h
* 
*  Description:
*	Public header file for the Handspring extensions to PalmOS
*
*  ToDo:
* 
*  History:
*	13-Jul-2000 BP - Created by Bob Petersen from NewTypes.h from John
*	Marshall at Palm.  
*
*  From John Marshall: 
*     With Palm OS SDKs prior to the 3.5 SDK, programmers were encouraged
*  to use typedefs such as `DWord' and `VoidHand' rather than the built-in
*  types.  In the 3.5 SDK, the names of these typedefs have been changed to
*  the somewhat more mnemonic `UInt32' (etc) and the rather more
*  functional `MemHandle'.  (Previously there were two "handle" datatypes,
*  `VoidHand' and `Handle', with no real reason for a distinction between
*  them, and programmers were continually casting between them.
*  `MemHandle' corrects this historical accident.)
*  
*     People wanting to write library header files capable of interacting
*  with any SDK have a dilemma:  which to use, old- or new-style type
*  names?
*  
*     You can use old-style names by instructing users to include
*  `PalmCompatibility.h' before including your header file if they are
*  using the 3.5 SDK.  But this is not very satisfactory:  the onus
*  shouldn't be on users to get this right, and you might prefer to use
*  new-style names.
*  
*  You can ensure new-style names are available simply by including
*  `NewTypes.h' at the top of your header file, and instructing users to
*  include at least `Common.h'/`PalmTypes.h' before your header.  (They
*  are probably including `Pilot.h'/`PalmOS.h' anyway.)
*  
*  Including `NewTypes.h' provides the following:
*  
*  * The identifiers `UInt8', `Int8', `UInt16', `Int16', `UInt32',
*  `Int32', `MemPtr', and `MemHandle' are all typedeffed
*  appropriately.
*  
*  * The macro `SDK_VERSION' is defined to either 10, 20, 30, 31, or 35,
*  indicating the SDK version which is in use.
*
