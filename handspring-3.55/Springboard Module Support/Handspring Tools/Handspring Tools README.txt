Palm OS project). This project must be built using CodeWarrior for Palm OS 
Platform, Version 8.0 with the Handspring SDK headers installed.

HandspringLnk

This is the CodeWarrior IDE plugin version of Handspring's command-line 
MakeROM linker. It uses the Handspring MakeROM settings panel. The plugin was 
built using CodeWarrior for Windows or Mac OS, Version 6.0 with the Palm OS 
3.5 SDK and CodeWarrior SDK installed.

MakeROM
=======
Handspring's command-line MakeROM linker ported to build using CodeWarrior. It
creates a ROM file image from a set of .prc files. Can also be used to print
information on an existing ROM image, break down an existing ROM image into 
a set of .prc files, or patch an existing ROM image by adding ROM tokens. Must
be built using CodeWarrior for Windows or Mac OS, Version 7.0 with the Palm OS
