This is a stationery project for a CardUpdater application that runs on
a Handspring device. This stationery enables you to easily create a custom 
application for updating the flash memory on your Springboard(TM) flash module.
You supply the ROMs resource file created by the ROM stationery, and the project 
generates a "CardUpdater" application that runs on Handspring, Inc. handheld 
devices runnning the PalmOS operating system.

To customize your card updater application, edit the CardUpdaterRes.rsrc file.
Objects that should be customized:

- The application name

- String resOvrStrIDHelpText (id 5000)

	This string is used as the "tip" in the Update Software alert as well as
	displayed when the user taps the "Info" button on the Updater's main form.
	Here, you should provide helpful information about your Updater to the user.
	Explain what it is, what it does, and what are the ramifications, etc. Keep
	in mind who your target audience is.
	
- String resOvrStrIDMainFormTitleText (id 5001)
	This string is used as the title of the main form, replace it with the
	text that you want to appear in your Updater's title bar.
	Make sure it will fit within the Updater's title bar.

- String resOvrStrIDBuildDate (id 5002)
	This string is used as the module build date.

- String resOvrStrIDStartUpdateAlertMsg (id 5003)
	This string is used into the "Update Software" alert (prompt) that is
	displayed after the user taps the "Update Now" button.  The alert will have
	"OK" and "Cancel" controls.  Here, provide a short description of what will
	happen and ask if the user wants to continue.

- String resOvrStrIDResetAlertMsg (id 5004)
	This string is used into the alert that gets displayed at
	the end of a successful update.  The alert will have a "Reset"
	control.  Once the user taps the "Reset" control, the system
	will soft-reset. Provide information that is appropriate at this
	point.
 
- String resOvrStrIDModuleProductName (id 5005)
	This string specifies the name of the module product for using
	in the updater's user interface (alerts, prompts, etc.).

- String resOvrStrIDChipSelectAutoConfigScheme (id 5006)
	Flash module configuration detection and chip-select configuration
	setting -- DO NOT LOCALIZE!!!
	0 (zero) = leave Springboard chip selects at their default values.
	1 = auto-detect and configure flash module configurations where the
	    flash chips' chip-enable inputs are driven directly by the 1 or
	    both Springboard chip-select signals (i.e. -- those that don't
	    rely on their own address decoding logic.
	other values = reserved by Handspring, Inc. for future enhancements.
	
- String List resOvrSTLCompatibilityList (id 5000)
	This string list object is used to specify a list of modules that the
	Update is compatible with.  The generated Updater application will use
	this information to determine whether the update image contained in the
	Updater may be written to the module.
