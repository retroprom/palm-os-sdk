This is a copy of the Handspring Springboard modules plugins and projects we shipped with CodeWarrior for 
Palm OS V8, Professional Edition.  We have not updated these plugins or projects for V9, and we know that 
there will be some migration problems moving to the Palm OS 5 SDK.  These are provided as-is and without
support.
