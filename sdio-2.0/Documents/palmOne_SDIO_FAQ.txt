palmOne SDIO SDK 2.0
------------------------------------------

1. What kind of SD/SDIO support is available on palmOne handhelds?

a) The latest palmOne handhelds (Palm OS 5.X) have the SD driver and the SDIO driver
in the ROM. Out of the box these handhelds can recognize MultiMedia Cards,
SD Cards, and SDIO Cards.

b) The palmOne handhelds m130 and m515 have the SD driver and the SDIO driver in
ROM. Out of the box these handhelds can recognize MultiMedia Cards, SD Cards,
and SDIO Cards.

c) The palm handhelds m125, m500, m505, and i705 have the SD driver in ROM.
They do not have the SDIO driver in ROM. Out of the box these handhelds can
recognize MultiMedia Cards and SD Cards, but they cannot recognize SDIO Cards.
The SDIO driver must be installed in RAM on these handhelds before inserting
any SDIO card into the expansion slot or else the SDIO card will not be
recognized.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Can you provide information about SDIO pin descriptions, handshaking, etc?

This level of detail requires membership in SD Card Association
(www.sdcard.org). You must join the association before they will provide the
low-level documentation on SD Cards and SDIO Cards.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. I would like to know how to use the SDIO Development Card #1?

Any PluggedIn member can buy this tool from the Expansion Parts Store,

Read the file "SDIODevelopmentCard1.pdf" contained in this SDK.
The document contains instructions
for its use (reprogram the PIC, CPLD, etc.).

Technical support is limited to: the SDIO card in its present hardware
configuration, the present implementation of the firmware's
source code (PIC & CPLD), and the present implementation of the Palm OS
application's source code (uploaded to the handheld from flash memory
when the SDIO card is inserted into the expansion slot).

The serial port (DB-9) and some unused exposed signals (from the PIC & CPLD)
are not enabled to work by the existing firmware, so their use is not supported
by palmOne, Inc. These were put there for developers to use for experimentation.

NOTE:
The SDIO Development Card #1 was tested with palmOne handhelds by inserting the
card to verify that plug and play happens without a problem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. How do you determine if a handheld with and expansion slot has SDIO support?

A simple clean straight forward statement cannot be made to developers regarding
how to check to determine if a handheld has SDIO support or not because of the
following:

* Adding the SDIO patch does not change the Palm OS version reported on
  m500 (Palm OS 4.0), m505 (Palm OS 4.0), m125 (Palm OS 4.0.1).
* SDIO is not a supported feature in i705, adding the SDIO patch does not change
  the version (Palm OS 4.1) reported.
* SDIO is a supported feature in m130 (Palm OS 4.1).
* SDIO is a supported feature in m515 (Palm OS 4.1).

Search for the OS version:
1. Palm OS 5.X
SDIO support is in the ROM.

2. Palm OS 4.0 or Palm OS 4.0.1
The handheld needs the SDIO patch.
Search for the SDIO patch file name.
If found, the SDIO patch is already installed.
If not found, install the SDIO patch.

3. Palm OS 4.1
a. If the handheld is an i705, it needs the SDIO patch.
Search for the SDIO patch file name.
If found the SDIO patch is already installed.
If not found, install the SDIO patch.

b. If the handheld is not an i705, the SDIO patch is not needed.
SDIO support is in the ROM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. My application produces a 'Fatal Alert' "Fatal Exception" message box, why?

A Palm OS application should check the Form ID before attempting to write to a
Form. If not, then a 'Fatal Alert' "Fatal Exception" message box appears when
it attempts to write to the wrong Form.

For example. An SDIO card with plug and play is inserted into the expansion
slot. The application is loaded. The application is launched. The SDIO card is
removed. The SDIO card is inserted. A 'Handheld Error' message box appears. The
SDIO card is removed. A 'Fatal Alert' "Fatal Exception" message box appears.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Is there any API to put the palmOne handheld in the SDIO SPI mode?
   How can I use SDIO SPI mode on a palmOne handheld?

A  There is no API to force the palmOne handheld into SPI mode. The palmOne handheld starts off in
   SDIO SD-1 Bit. It tries to communicate with the SDIO card in SDIO SD-1 Bit by sending a CMD0. If the
   communication fails (response has errors) then the palmOne handheld tries to communicate with the SDIO card in SDIO
   SPI mode. If that works then the palmOne handheld will operate in SDIO SPI mode.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Are there any known issues with SDIORWExtendedBlock API on palmOne Handhelds?

A  On some palmOne handhelds including Tungsten C, the SDIORWExtendedBlock may not
function with some cards. palmOne recommends using SDIORWExtendedByte instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Why can't I get interrupts from the card on various palmOne handhelds like
   Zire 72, Tungsten T5, etc.?

A  Some of the palmOne handhelds like Zire 72, Tungsten T5, etc. have interrupts
   disabled by default. Interrupts have to be explicitly enabled using
   SDIOEnableHandheldInterrupt in your Application.

   FtrGet( sysFtrCreator, sysFtrNumOEMDeviceID, &deviceID );
   if ( deviceID == 'Zi72' || deviceID == 'TnT5' )
   {
       SDIOEnableHandheldInterrupt( gSlotLibRefNum );
   }

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. How do I use the SDIOGetAutoRun API on a palmOne handheld?

A. The following code snippet show how to use the SDIOGetAutoRun.


Err CheckCardInserted( )
{
	Err					 	err;
	UInt32				 	slotIterator;
	UInt16				 	slotRefNum;
	UInt16				 	slotLibRefNum;
	UInt32				 	mediaType;
	UInt16				 	count				= 0;	
	SDIOAutoRunInfoType		autoRun;

	
	slotIterator = expIteratorStart;
	while ( slotIterator != expIteratorStop )
	{	
		err = ExpSlotEnumerate( &slotRefNum, &slotIterator );
		if ( err )
		{
			// Failed to enumerate the slot
			break;
		}
		
		err = ExpSlotLibFind(slotRefNum,  &slotLibRefNum);
		if ( !err )
		{
			
			err = SlotMediaType( slotLibRefNum, slotRefNum, &mediaType );
			
			if ( !err )
			{
			
				if ( mediaType == expMediaType_SecureDigital )
				{
					gSlotLibRefNum		= slotLibRefNum;
					autoRun.sdioSlotNum = sdioSlotFunc1; //only look in function 1
					err					= SDIOGetAutoRun( slotLibRefNum, &autoRun );
					
					if ( err == errNone )
					{
						// The autoRun has valid values for the following:
						// autoRun.oemManufacturer
						// autoRun.oemID
						// autoRun.oemFunctionStandard
						// autoRun.oemFunctionNum
						// autoRun.media
					}				
										
				}
			

			}
		}
	}	
	
	return 0;
}

10. What kind of SDIO support (SPI, SD-1 bit or SD-4 bit) is available on palmOne handhelds?

A. Please refer to the palmOne Developer Guide for more details regarding the SDIO support
available on the latest palmOne handhelds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Does the palmOne EDK work on Palm OS 5.X? How come the palmOne EDK does not work on some of the
    palmOne devices?

A. The palmOne EDK supports SDIO SPI mode only. It works on all the palmOne devices, including the
   Palm OS 5.X devices, that support SDIO SPI mode.
